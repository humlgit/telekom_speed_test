# telekom_speed_test

Unready writting code for checking speed of internet automaticly via original "Telekom Speed Test". Code is writting for Linux and Windows, if it's ready! planned Features:
 - automatic startup speed test in webbrowser --> works with restrictions
 - save result as screenshot in ..//pictures/telekom (create directory by it's own, if not there) --> works
 - read out values of ping, up- and download, save them in .txt and create an overview/diagramm --> not working
 - self determined times for checking speed (daily/hourly/every minute/self/...) --> works with changes in code
